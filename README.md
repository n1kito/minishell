**The shell should:**
- [ ] Display a **prompt** when waiting for a new command
- [ ] Have a working history
- [ ] Search and launch the right executable (based on the `PATH` variable or using a relative or an absolute path).
- [ ] Not use more than **one global variable**. Think about it. You will have to explain its purpose.
- [ ] Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not requires by the subject such as `\` or `;`.
- [ ] Handle ' (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quotes sequence.
- [ ] Handle `"` (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-characters in the quotes sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
- [ ] Implement **redirections**
  - [ ] `<` should redirect input.
  - [ ] `>` should redirect output.
  - [ ] `<<` should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesn't have to update the history.
  - [ ] `>>` should redirect output in append mode.
- [ ] Implement **pipes** (`|` character). The output of each command in the pipeline is connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
- [ ] Handle **environment variables** (`$` followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values.
- [ ] Handle `$?` which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- [ ] Handle `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D` and `ctrl-\` which should behave like in bash.
- [ ] In interactive mode
  - [ ] `ctrl-C` displays a new prompt on a new line.
  - [ ] `ctrl-D` exits the shell.
  - [ ] `ctrl-\` does nothing.
- [ ] Your shell must implement the following **builtins**:
  - [ ] `echo` with option `-n`
  - [ ] `cd` with only a relative or absolute path
  - [ ] `pwd` with no options
  - [ ] `export` with no options
  - [ ] `unset` with no options
  - [ ] `env` with no options or arguments
  - [ ] `exit` with no options

> The `readline()` function can cause memory leaks. You don't have to fix them. But that **does not mean your own code can have memory leaks**.

> You should limit yourself to the subject description. Anything that is not asked is not required. If you have any doubt about a requirement, take bash as a reference.
